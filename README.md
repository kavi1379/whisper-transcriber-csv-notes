# Whisper Transcriber – Structured CSV Notes from Audio

This is a simple AI-assisted project that I assembled using Whisper (OpenAI) and other tools to transcribe academic audio (e.g. university lectures) into structured CSV notes. The goal was to transform voice recordings into clean, exportable notes that resemble lecture-style summaries.

## How It Works

- Input: Recorded lecture audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.)
- Processing: Whisper transcribes the speech → sentences are cleaned and structured
- Output: CSV file with organized lines of lecture notes

## Platform

- Works on Android and Windows (compiled version – not open source code)
- Built using existing AI services and custom workflow design (no original model development)

## Why This Matters

This project helped me understand how to turn raw input into usable, structured data — a mindset I believe applies directly to many bioinformatics challenges like sequence annotation or omics data parsing.
