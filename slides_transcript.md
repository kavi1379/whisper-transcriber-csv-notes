### Slide 1

Good afternoon everyone. Today we are going to talk about protein folding and how its distribution can lead to disease. Proteins need to adopt a specific three-dimensional structure in order to function properly. When this process fails, it can cause aggregation and cellular stress, which is a common feature which are in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

### Slide 2

There are molecular chaperones in the cell that help proteins fold correctly. However, when these systems are overhelmed, misfolded proteins accumulate and may become toxic.

### Slide 2

We will also discuss how bioinformatics tools can predict protein structure and identify potential disordered regions. These predictions are essential for understanding protein function and designing targeted traputhic.
