    "text": "Good afternoon everyone. Today we are going to talk about protein folding and how its distribution can lead to disease. Proteins need to adopt a specific three-dimensional structure in order to function properly. When this process fails, it can cause aggregation and cellular stress, which is a common feature which are in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's."
